You cannot fake them, you cannot mint extra ones, and you cannot subdivide them below 8 decimal places.',

Each halving reduces the rate of new QD issuance by 50%, extending the total distribution timeline while preserving the mathematical supply ceiling. The halving schedule is fully public, deterministic, and cannot be altered by any party.',
      'The consequence of this schedule is predictable: early network participants who contribute infrastructure and liquidity receive a proportionally larger share of the total supply.
